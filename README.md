MASCrypt is a calculating tool on basic arithmetic operations and also modular arithmetic operations commonly used in cryptography. It is intended both for the study and learning of cryptography, but also for crypto professionals. Calculations can be made in Base-2 (binary), Base-10 (decimal) and Base-16 (hexadecimal) using very large integers.

List of available operations:
* [Addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition)
* [Substraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtraction)
* [Multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication)
* [Division](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_(mathematics))
* [Square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_root)
* [Primitive root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_root_modulo_n)
* [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or) (*Exclusive OR*)
* [Module inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse)
* [Exponentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation)
* [Module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_(mathematics))
* [GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) (*Greatest Common Divisor*)
* [LCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple) (*Least Common Multiple*)
* [Primality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)
